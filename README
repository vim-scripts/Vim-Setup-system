This script is a modified version of the Setup script created by Jos van RisWick and which can be found here: 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/vim/setup.vim

Modifications:
- This package includes all the external scripts needed in order to make this script work.
- All scripts are modified such that they expect to find the other scripts in the plugin folder in vimhome instead of in the users home directory. 
- fixed an incompatibility with vim 7.0 and newer
Please see Jos' site for more info about the script.
